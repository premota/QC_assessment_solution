# K-Means Clustering Project

## Overview
This project involves the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify inherent groupings within a dataset. K-Means is a popular and computationally efficient clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K predefined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters), where each data point belongs to only one group.

## Technique
The K-Means algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in clustering large datasets. The procedure follows these steps:

## Initialization: Start by selecting K initial centroids randomly from the data points.
Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance.
Update: Calculate the new centroids as the mean of the points assigned to each cluster.
Iteration: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the positions of the centroids stabilize (convergence).
The number of clusters (K) was determined using the elbow method, which involves plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters and choosing the elbow point of the curve as the number of clusters to use.

## Results
The application of K-Means resulted in clear and distinct clusters, with each cluster representing a unique subgroup within the dataset. Visualizations were created using t-SNE to reduce dimensionality and provide a visual representation of the clusters, highlighting the separation and aggregation of the data points within each cluster.

## Key findings from the clustering include:
- Distinct patterns and groupings that were not previously observable.
- Identification of outliers and anomalies within the data.
- Visualization
- Visual results are provided in the visuals/ directory, which includes scatter plots showing the distribution of the clusters.

## Limitations
### While K-Means provided valuable insights, there are several limitations to consider:
- Sensitivity to Outliers: K-Means is sensitive to outliers, which can distort the clustering results.
- Assumption of Cluster Shape: The algorithm assumes that clusters are spherical and of similar size, which might not always hold true for real-world data.
- Dependence on Initial Centroids: The final results can vary significantly based on the initial selection of centroids. Multiple runs with different seeds were performed to mitigate this issue.
- Choosing K: Determining the optimal number of clusters requires domain knowledge or a method like the elbow method, which might not always provide a clear cut-off point.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the utility of K-Means in uncovering hidden structures within the dataset, facilitating a better understanding of its characteristics. However, the noted limitations must be considered when interpreting the results. Future work could explore more robust clustering techniques like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering, which do not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand and can handle outliers more effectively.

## Comment on Feature Engineering and Clustering
If additional context about the dataset becomes available, it could greatly enhance our clustering efforts. Advanced feature engineering techniques can be leveraged to derive new features that capture more nuanced aspects of the data. These refined features would likely aid in the generation of more distinct and meaningful clusters by improving the representativeness and separation ability of the dataset within the feature space. This approach not only promises better clustering performance but also deeper insights into the underlying patterns and relationships.
